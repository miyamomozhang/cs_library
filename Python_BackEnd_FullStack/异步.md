Starlette (and FastAPI) are based on AnyIO, which makes it compatible with both Python's standard library asyncio and Trio.
In particular, you can directly use AnyIO for your advanced concurrency use cases that require more advanced patterns in your own code.
And even if you were not using FastAPI, you could also write your own async applications with AnyIO to be highly compatible and get its benefits (e.g. structured concurrency).


In previous versions of Python, you could have used threads or Gevent. But the code is way more complex to understand, debug, and think about.
